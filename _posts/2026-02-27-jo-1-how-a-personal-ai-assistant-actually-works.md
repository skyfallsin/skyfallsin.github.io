Jo is a new AI that makes you go 10x faster, without compromising on raw power or sovereignty.

**For whom?** Whether you're checking bitcoin prices or reading the endless emails from your kids' schools, Jo is for people who want an AI assistant that actually knows them and doesn't hand their personal data to a shared cloud.

**How?** Half runs on your Mac, half on a dedicated machine in the cloud. Available on macOS, Telegram, and WhatsApp. With UX designed for daily life.

Let's say you're planning a weekend trip to Yosemite with your kids. Here's how Jo helps, end to end.

# 10x faster everywhere

## It notices things

You've been browsing Yosemite trail guides, checking campsite availability, and reading a blog post about kid-friendly hikes. A local model on your Mac groups all of this into a clip: "Yosemite Weekend Trip." You never tagged anything or created a folder. Jo just noticed.

Nothing leaves your machine. But when you ask Jo a question, it already has the context.

## It knows you

"What was that campsite Sarah recommended last summer?" Jo searches every conversation across every channel and finds it. It knows your kids' ages, that you prefer tent camping over cabins, and that you always pack the car the night before.

Plain text notes, daily logs, and decisions. Not a black box. Just files you can read and edit. A nightly reflection loop reviews the day's sessions and rewrites its own behavioral rules. Jo gets better at being your assistant without you doing anything.

## Voice while you do other things

You're packing the car and your hands are full. "Hey Jo, what's the weather in Yosemite this weekend?" Voice transcription runs locally on your Mac. Echo cancellation means no headphones needed. You talk while you work. Jo responds.

## Always in your messengers

On the road, text Jo on Telegram to find a lunch stop. At the campsite, send a voice message on WhatsApp: "What time does the visitor center close?" Jo responds in audio. Your phone is always with you. So is Jo.

## Deep app integrations

Jo checks your Google Calendar for conflicts, reads your Gmail for the campsite reservation confirmation, and pulls up the trail photos you saved last time from your Photos library. 

Local: Safari, Chrome, Notes, Slack, Messages, Photos, Reminders, Finder. With your permission, Jo reads actual content, not screenshots.

Remote: Google Calendar, Gmail, Google Drive. Connected through your account, with your permission, queried from your cloud machine.

## It does things when you're not there

The morning of the trip, Jo sends a briefing: weather forecast for Yosemite, your campsite check-in time pulled from Gmail, a reminder to pack the kids' hiking boots, and current road conditions.

You set it up once: "Every Friday before a weekend trip, send me a prep briefing." It runs on your dedicated machine and delivers to whichever channel you're on.

## Same Jo everywhere

Voice on your Mac at home. Telegram in the car. WhatsApp at the campsite. Same memory, same personality, same context. One conversation that flows across every channel.

# Raw power, but fast

## Two tiers, not one

"What time is check-in?" comes back in one to two seconds. "Research the best kid-friendly trails in Yosemite Valley, compare distances and elevation, and build us a two-day itinerary" routes to a reasoning model automatically. You don't choose. Jo does.

## You pick the models

OpenAI, Anthropic, Grok, Kimi. More coming. Jo also ships with a local model that runs entirely on your Mac. Swap anytime.

## Real browser

Jo doesn't simulate browsing. It controls a real browser on a separate machine. It checks campsite availability on recreation.gov, reads trail conditions on the NPS site, and finds gas stations along your route. Sites see a normal user, not a bot.

# Sovereignty

## Your own machine

Every Jo user gets a dedicated machine in the cloud. Your storage, your compute, your data. Not a row in someone else's database. A real machine that only you use.

Your cloud storage mounts as a drive on your Mac. Open it in Finder. Your trip notes, your packing lists, your conversation history. Regular files in a regular folder.

## What stays local

Personal data never leaves your Mac. The photos from last year's trip, your kids' school schedule, your screen content. All processed locally. The local model that builds your clips runs on-device with no network calls.

Jo's cloud machine handles conversations and tasks. Your Mac handles everything personal.

## Inference you can trust

Cloud inference runs on providers with contracts that prevent training on your data. You can run fully local if you want.

## Built on open roots

Jo stands on the shoulders of open-source giants. Battle-tested code, part of the community we love and [contribute back to](https://github.com/jo-inc).
