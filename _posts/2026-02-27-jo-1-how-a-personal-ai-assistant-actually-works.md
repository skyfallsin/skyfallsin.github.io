Jo is a new AI that makes you go 10x faster, without compromising on raw power or sovereignty.

**For whom?** Whether you're checking bitcoin prices or reading the endless emails from your kids' schools, Jo is for people who want an AI assistant that actually knows them and doesn't hand their personal data to a shared cloud.

**How?** Half runs on your Mac, half on a dedicated machine in the cloud. Available on macOS, Telegram, and WhatsApp. With UX designed for daily life.

# Jo makes you 10x better

## It knows you

Jo remembers everything. Every conversation across every channel is searchable. "Find all convos that mentioned Japan." It maintains plain text notes, daily logs, and decisions. Not a black box. Just files you can read and edit.

A nightly reflection loop reviews the day's sessions and rewrites its own behavioral rules. Jo gets better at being your assistant without you doing anything.

## It notices things

A local model runs on your Mac, processing what you're working on into organized clips. Researching flights, comparing apartments, reading about Tokyo neighborhoods. Jo groups and summarizes these automatically.

Nothing leaves your machine. But when you ask Jo a question, it has context you never had to provide.

## It talks and listens

Voice transcription runs locally. Echo cancellation means no headphones needed. You talk, Jo responds. On Telegram and WhatsApp, it handles voice messages too, and can respond in audio.

## It does things when you're not there

Morning briefings. Weekly planning. Custom alerts: "tell me if BTC drops below $90K." Scheduled tasks run on your dedicated machine and deliver to whichever channel you're on.

## Deep app integrations

Local: Safari, Chrome, Notes, Slack, Messages, Photos, Reminders, Finder. With your permission, Jo reads actual content, not screenshots.

Remote: Google Calendar, Gmail, Google Drive. Connected through your account, with your permission, queried from your cloud machine.

## Same Jo everywhere

Mac, Telegram, WhatsApp. Same memory, same personality, same capabilities. Start a conversation on your Mac, continue it on Telegram from your phone.

# Raw power, but fast

## Two tiers, not one

Simple requests hit a fast model and come back in one to two seconds. Complex requests route to a reasoning model automatically. You don't choose. Jo does.

## You pick the models

OpenAI, Anthropic, Grok, Kimi. More coming. Jo also ships with a local model that runs entirely on your Mac. Swap anytime.

## Real browser

Jo doesn't simulate browsing. It controls a real browser on a separate machine. It reads pages, clicks links, fills forms. Sites see a normal user, not a bot.

# Sovereignty

## Your own machine

Every Jo user gets a dedicated machine in the cloud. Your storage, your compute, your data. Not a row in someone else's database. A real machine that only you use.

Your cloud storage mounts as a drive on your Mac. Open it in Finder. Browse your notes, logs, and memory files like any other folder.

## What stays local

Personal data never leaves your Mac. Screen content, photos, files, voice audio. All processed locally. The local model that builds your clips runs on-device with no network calls.

Jo's cloud machine handles conversations and tasks. Your Mac handles everything personal.

## Inference you can trust

Cloud inference runs on providers with contracts that prevent training on your data. You can run fully local if you want.

## Built on open roots

Jo stands on the shoulders of open-source giants. Battle-tested code, part of the community we love and [contribute back to](https://github.com/jo-inc).
